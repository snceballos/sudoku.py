I was able to solve all of the boards given. Some took a bit longer than normal due to the amount of 0s on the board. One example was this board: the
0 7 0 0 2 1 0 0 4
0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0
6 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 2
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0
0 0 8 6 0 0 7 0 3
1 9 0 0 0 0 0 4 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 8
4 2 0 9 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
This board took around 1 minute to compile and solve.
