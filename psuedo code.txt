1. 1-9 in column
2. 1-9 in row
3. 1-9 square

check if number is on column
check if number is on row
check if number is in square

given row if x is on row move to next row if not stay there
given column if x is on column move to next column


create a code to have the index be 3x3, 6x3, 9x3
bounds are 3 rows
1-3, a-c
4-6, a-c
7-9, a-c
1-3, d-f
4-6, d-f

if x is not on row, check column, check square then place value

every code we have would be based off of a number 1-9

for 1
check row
check column
check square
insert 1 0

min value heuristic section: find row/column with the most number given already
row with the least of 0 we check that column to see the least amount of 0 too
find 0 value from certain spot on board

heuristic: identify easiest row/column to solve
possible: check algorithm if number is in row/column/square
solve: then put solved number into spot
recurse it until its solved

counter for 0 
variable to store largest amount of numbers in section

find missing number from 1-9 in row a

by array
what fits in row
then column
then square
finds best value
